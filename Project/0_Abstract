##ROTARY ENCODER

#DESCRIPTION

            Rotary encoder is used to know the position of movement and angular movement of a motor or axis. Itâ€™s a three terminal device usually,
            with power and ground pin counts to five.

The pins of a rotary encoder are:

Ground.
Positive connected to +5V
Output signal A pin
Output signal B pin
Clock pin or common pin.

#[1] How much resolution is needed?

Select the optimal model in view of required precision and cost of machine equipment.
We recommend selecting a resolution of from 1/2 to 1/4 of the precision of the machine with which the Encoder will be used

#[2] Dimensions
Take into consideration the type of shaft that is required (hollow shaft or regular shaft) in relation to mounting space.

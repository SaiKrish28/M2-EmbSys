EXPLANATION OF BLOCK DIAGRAM:

1) POWER SUPPLY
               It involves transformers, capacitors and regulators
               
2) TRAFFIC MOVEMENT FEEDBACK
               It is necessary to sense on which side of the road the traffic is heavy
               
3) MICROCONTROLLER UNIT
               It takes the information from the feedback section, determines the time for each lane, controls the lane
               
4) TIME DISPLAY
               This display unit is connected to the microcontroller for the purpose of time display
               
5) TRAFFIC LIGHT
                It displays colours red, yellow and green to indicate stop, ready and go respectively. These colours are driven by the microcontroller
                
6) DRIVER
                It determines what the microcontroller must do, like sensing and analysing the feedbacks,controlling the traffic light etc.
